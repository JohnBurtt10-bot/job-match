The AIMS Lab works at the interface of translating between basic computational neuroimaging approaches and applying/validating these for the clinical practice of neurosurgery along with the Khan Computational Lab.\n\nThe position is supported by funded projects including from the McGill and Western Initiative for Translational Neuroscience (ITN), "Translating epilepsy neuroimaging biomarkers into the operating room" (Western PI: Lau) and TRIDENT (Western PI: Khan). This project aims to enhance the translation of research-grade MRI biomarkers of epilepsy into the operating room. Based on high- and ultra- high field neuroimaging acquisitions in Montreal and London, the team will derive patient-specific maps leveraging open-access tools developed and will contribute to their refinement and validation. The applicant will also develop software to convert these maps into commercial neuronavigation software used by surgeons at the Neuro, Western, and collaborating hospitals. Our project aims to establish a novel neuroinformatics workflow to enhance surgical target definition with seamless integration into the operating room, which will have the potential to positively impact seizure control and the well-being of Canadians suffering from epilepsy.\n\nThe hire will work with the PI (Dr. Lau), graduate students , technical staff (software developers, and administrative staff (research assistants). In addition, opportunities will be available to observe in the clinic and operating room to see how these techniques make their way into clinical practice. The hire will also receive direct mentorship from the PI who is a former Waterloo Co-Op student regarding the potential of applying their technical skillset to biomedical applications like those proposed in this job. Opportunities to consider graduate studies or medical studies can be tailored to the applicant\'s career trajectory.\n\nIn addition, the hire will also be co-supervised by Dr. Ali Khan who is an Associate Professor and Scientist at the Robarts Research Institute and Canada Research Chair in Computational Neuroimaging who runs the Khan Computational Imaging Lab. The Khan lab works with medical images including magnetic resonance imaging and microscopy, and develops and applies computational techniques and is a close collaborator with the PI.\n\nhttps://www.schulich.uwo.ca/cns//people/faculty/neurosurgeons/bio-lau.html\nhttps://github.com/khanlab\nhttps://github.com/afids\nhttp://www.khanlab.ca\njclauneurolab.io', 'Job Responsibilities:': 'Job Responsibilities:\n\n- Develop and deploy software for image standardization, processing, and analysis on local compute systems and Digital Research Alliance of Canada\nManage, plan, and execute related projects under the direction of the PI (Lau) and PI (Khan)\n- Define, develop, and document software requirements, objectives, deliverables, and specifications on a project-by-project basis in collaboration with the PI and other investigators\n- Provide technical presentations to end-users of the developed software platforms\n- Creates and update documentation to support access to processes and policies, both internal and user-facing, as instructed\n- Troubleshoot and resolve problems, research and recommend resolutions for problems encountered, providing options for consideration as required\n- Support the deployment and management of containerized applications (e.g., Docker, Singularity) across compute environments\n- Conducts research and makes recommendations on emerging application development, software products, languages, frameworks, standards and practices\n- Produce test sets for validating software tools', 'Required Skills:': 'Required Skills:\n- Experience with Python for scientific software development (e.g. numpy, pandas, pytorch, nibabel)\n- Experience working with neural networks\n- Experience with software version control systems (e.g. Git, Github)\n- Experience working in a Linux environment\n- Experience with containerized applications (e.g., Docker, Singularity)\nUseful skills to have (otherwise will be trained):\n- Experience working in neuroscience, neuroimaging and/or computational neuroscience research environments would be an asset\n- Experience with machine learning and image processing standards\n- Experience with modern website development frameworks (e.g. React.js)\n- Experience working with cloud infrastructure\n- Experience with workflow management systems (e.g. Snakemake)\n- Experience working with large scale datasets\n- Experience working with open-source repositories and open-access datasets', 'Transportation and Housing:': 'The Off-Campus Housing Service at Western University provides students/staff a variety of housing options: https://offcampus.uwo.ca\nAlternatively if the co-op student wishes to commute from Kitchener/Waterloo, a hybrid schedule could be negotiated.', 'Compensation and Benefits:': 'Compensation will be in line with co-op student earnings in Software Engineering commensurate with work term number.', 'Targeted Degrees and Disciplines:': '', 'Application Deadline': 'May 13, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t9:00 AM', 'Application Documents Required:': 'University of Waterloo Co-op Work History,Cover Letter,Résumé,Grade Report', 'Additional Application Information:': 'We would encourage applications from prospective students who are interested in either an 8 month consecutive work term or 2 work term commitment to allow for more in depth and long-term milestones to be achieved.', 'Application Method:': 'WaterlooWorks', 'Organization:': 'London Health Sciences Centre', 'Division:': 'Neurosurgery', 'Job Posting ID': 'Software Developer - Neurosurgical and Imaging Research Applications'}

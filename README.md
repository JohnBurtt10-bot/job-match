# Job Match: Smarter Job Swiping for WaterlooWorks

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

**Waterloo Students:**
- Use the main app here: [https://job-match.onrender.com/](https://job-match.onrender.com/)  
(Log in with your WaterlooWorks credentials to see your real jobs, AI-ranked and swipable!)

**Just want to try it?**
- Try the live demo (no login required): [https://job-match.onrender.com/demo](https://job-match.onrender.com/demo)
  - The demo uses sample resume and job data, but shows the full AI-powered swiping experience.

## Why I Built This

As a student at the University of Waterloo, I noticed a persistent gap in how AI tools approach job applications: they rarely optimize the order in which jobs are shown to users. At the same time, many students (myself included) have been frustrated with the new WaterlooWorks UI/UX, which can be slow, unintuitive, and overwhelmingâ€”especially during co-op application season.

**Job Match** was created to streamline the job search and application process for Waterloo students. By leveraging AI, it not only automates tedious tasks but also intelligently prioritizes job postings, helping students focus on the most relevant opportunities first.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Job Ranking:** Uses your resume and preferences to evaluate and prioritize job postings.
- **Automated Job Parsing:** Scrapes and parses jobs from WaterlooWorks using Playwright.
- **Smart Swiping UI:** Presents jobs in an optimized order, allowing you to accept/reject with a single click.
- **Automated Application:** Optionally auto-applies to jobs you approve.
- **Resume Extraction:** Handles both text-based and (optionally) image-based resumes.
- **Persistent User Sessions:** Remembers your progress and preferences.
- **Robust Error Handling:** Designed to handle WaterlooWorks quirks and login flows, including DUO authentication.

## Technical Overview

### Stack

- **Backend:** Python, Flask, Playwright (for browser automation)
- **Frontend:** HTML/CSS (rendered via Flask templates)
- **AI/ML:** OpenAI API for job fit evaluation
- **PDF Parsing:** PyPDF2 (with optional OCR support via Tesseract and pdf2image)
- **Data Storage:** Diskcache (for job details and user sessions)
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Deployment:** Render.com

### Key Modules

- `src/core/playwright_job_parser.py`: Orchestrates browser automation, login, job scraping, and AI evaluation.
- `src/core/resume_utils.py`: Extracts and processes resume data, with special handling for test/demo users.
- `src/core/apply_to_job.py`: Automates the application process for selected jobs.
- `src/core/job_evaluator.py`: Evaluates job fit using AI.
- `src/web/app.py`: Flask web server, handles user sessions, job swiping UI, and API endpoints.
- `src/utils/config.py`: Centralized configuration and shared state.

### Frontend

- The UI is rendered using HTML templates (see `index_template.py`), designed for a clean, modern, and mobile-friendly experience.
- Users swipe through jobs, see detailed job info, and can accept/reject/apply with one click.

## How It Works

1. **Login:** User logs in with their WaterlooWorks credentials (handled securely in the backend).
2. **Resume Extraction:** The system downloads and parses the user's resume to understand their background.
3. **Job Scraping:** Playwright automates the browser to log in, navigate, and scrape all available job postings.
4. **AI Evaluation:** Each job is scored for fit using the user's resume and preferences.
5. **Job Swiping:** The user is presented with jobs in order of predicted fit, and can accept/reject/apply.
6. **Automated Application:** For accepted jobs, the system can auto-apply on the user's behalf.

## Local Development


### Setup

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JohnBurtt10-bot/job-match
   cd job-match
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install Playwright browsers:**
   ```bash
   playwright install
   ```

4. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   # Set environment variables (Windows PowerShell)
   $env:FLASK_DEBUG = "True"  # Optional: enables debug mode
   $env:FLASK_HOST = "0.0.0.0"  # Optional: allows external access
   $env:FLASK_PORT = "29000"  # Optional: custom port

   # Or for Linux/Mac
   export FLASK_DEBUG=True  # Optional: enables debug mode
   export FLASK_HOST=0.0.0.0  # Optional: allows external access
   export FLASK_PORT=29000  # Optional: custom port

   # Run the app (either method works)
   python -m src.web.app
   # Or using Flask CLI (alternative)
   # export FLASK_APP=src.web.app:app
   # python -m flask run
   ```

5. **Access the UI:**  
   - Main app: [http://localhost:29000](http://localhost:29000)
   - Demo mode: [http://localhost:29000/demo](http://localhost:29000/demo)

   Note: The demo mode supports multiple concurrent users and resets on page refresh.

## Configuration

- All configuration and shared state are managed in `src/utils/config.py`.

---

## Testing

- Tests are located in the `tests/` directory.
- Example: `tests/test_resume_utils.py` covers resume extraction logic.

Run tests with:
```bash
pytest tests/
```

---

## Known Limitations

- **WaterlooWorks UI changes:** If WaterlooWorks updates their UI, selectors may need to be updated.
- **DUO/MFA:** The system supports DUO, but manual intervention may be required for new devices.
- **OpenAI API:** Requires a valid API key and may incur costs.
